Description: A program for Bayesian analysis of univariate normal mixtures with an unknown number
  of components, following the approach of Richardson and Green (1997) <doi:10.1111/1467-9868.00095>.
  This makes use of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that are capable of jumping
  between the parameter sub-spaces corresponding to different numbers of components in the mixture.
  A sample from the full joint distribution of all unknown variables is thereby generated,
  and this can be used as a basis for a thorough presentation of many aspects of the posterior
  distribution.
