Description: A program for Bayesian analysis of univariate normal mixtures 
  with an unknown number of components. This makes use of reversible jump 
  Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that are capable of jumping between
  the parameter sub-spaces corresponding to different numbers of components
  in the mixture. A sample from the full joint distribution of all unknown
  variables is thereby generated, and this can be used as a basis for a 
  thorough presentation of many aspects of the posterior distribution.
